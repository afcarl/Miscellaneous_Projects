# Predicting if a person is a person of interest or not based on financial and email data from Enron scandal
#This was the final project in the Udacity Introduction to Machine Learning course

About the dataset
As preprocessing to this project, we've combined the Enron email and financial data into a dictionary, where each key-value pair in the dictionary corresponds to one person. The dictionary key is the person's name, and the value is another dictionary, which contains the names of all the features and their values for that person. The features available to you are the following:
['salary', 'to_messages', 'deferral_payments', 'total_payments', 'loan_advances', 'bonus', 'email_address', 'restricted_stock_deferred', 'deferred_income', 'total_stock_value', 'expenses', 'from_poi_to_this_person', 'exercised_stock_options', 'from_messages', 'other', 'from_this_person_to_poi', 'poi', 'long_term_incentive', 'shared_receipt_with_poi', 'restricted_stock', 'director_fees']
These fall into three major types of features, namely financial features, email features and POI labels.
financial features: ['salary', 'deferral_payments', 'total_payments', 'loan_advances', 'bonus', 'restricted_stock_deferred', 'deferred_income', 'total_stock_value', 'expenses', 'exercised_stock_options', 'other', 'long_term_incentive', 'restricted_stock', 'director_fees']  (all units are in US dollars)
email features: ['to_messages', 'email_address', 'from_poi_to_this_person', 'from_messages', 'from_this_person_to_poi', 'poi', 'shared_receipt_with_poi'] (units are generally number of emails messages; notable exception is ‘email_address’, which is a text string)
POI label: [‘poi’] (boolean, represented as integer)
